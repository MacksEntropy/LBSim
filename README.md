The file simulateFluid.py contains an implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method on a mesh with a circular obstacle. 
To run the code, clone the repo and then run `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment. The only dependencies are numPy and matplotlib.
Feel free to mess around with the parameters or change the obstacle in the simulation.
